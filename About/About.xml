[h1]&quot;[sd] floorpaint&quot;[/h1]

&quot;simple shapes to make stuff - totally necessary to not get your colonists killed!!!!!!&quot;
	
	- adds 1 research paint
	- adds item paintbucket
	- adds recipe to make paint bucket at stonecutter table
	- adds category and in there a bunch of shapes that you need (you can build on top of them like carpet basicly)
	
	Does not add more colors. It uses fabric+leather to color pick.
	For more color variety you might want to get additional mods. 
	

[h1]Details:[/h1]

you don&apos;t really need this mod. just me messing around.


the shapes are all 1x1 &quot;buildings&quot; with no hitpoints (=indestructible). you can deconstruct them, but get nothing back. they can stack on top, but i have no idea in what order and which/why some come out on top and some below.

you should be able to build almost anything on top of them (set to altitude level floor). you can build carpet/floors belwo them.

so yeah have fun planting your decorations in your base or show the raids with arrows where to go^^
