	Ver.: 1.0-1.0.0
	
	"simple shapes to make stuff -> totally necessary to not get your colonists killed!!!!!!"
	
	- adds 1 research paint
	- adds item paintbucket
	- adds recipe to make paint bucket at stonecutter table
	- adds category and in there a bunch of shapes that you need (you can build on top of them)
	
	Does not add more colors. It uses fabric+leather to color pick.
	For more color variety you might want to get additional mods.
